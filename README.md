SlapCrop
========

SlapCrop is an image resizer tool written by the development team at [Shaw Media, Inc.](http://www.shawmedia.ca/ "Shaw Media") in Toronto, Canada.

The goal is to offer dynamic scaling and cropping of images in both 1 and 2 pixel density scenarios in order to support our multi-screen applications.

## Documentation

This repo _*will*_ contain samples and examples of how to integrate SlapCrop into a typical .NET application (both Web Forms and MVC), however for the most up-to-date information please visit the project site at [http://shawonex.github.io/slapcrop/](http://shawonex.github.io/slapcrop/ "Slap Crop GitHub Pages").
